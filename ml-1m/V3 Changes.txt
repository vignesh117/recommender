V3 changes:

- Actually the existing strategy will work.
- Just need to fix the clustering process.
	- figure out why the affinity value do not affect the clustering process.
- Recommendations will be directly based on the clustering function.
	- When a point is presented for recommendation, the clustering function(dictionary in this case) gives us the bandit that it corresponds to
	- The bandit is just called and a movie is recommended based on the Q values learned.
- Fix a proper affinity threshold for changing the cluster of a point

20/5/2012
- Modified user profile for accurate clustering. added new function called info2 in user_info.py.
	- Each user will be now represented by a canonical vector containing bit vectors corresponding to its features.
- modified aff_clustering.py to accomodate changes in the user profile as in 1. The distance measure would see a change obviosly
